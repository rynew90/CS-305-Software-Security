# CS_305_Software_Security

*Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

    Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that creates finance plans for their clients, including savings, retirement, investment, and insurance. They wish to modernize their business and create custom software for their clients to interact with the business through using a public web interface. They are seeking assistance in ensuring that their software uses the most current and effective software security to ensure that their client’s data and financial information are protected.
    
*What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

    I feel I was effective in running vulnerability testing and determining the potential false positives when checking the client’s security vulnerabilities. Secure coding is vital to ensuring that software is safe to use, and the user’s data and personal information are protected from threats of attack or data loss. Ensuring that a user’s or company’s information is secure is just as important as making sure that the data in transit is not modified or altered before reaching the receiver of the data. Secure coding also ensures that a company’s reputation stays in good standing.
    
*What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

    Figuring out how to find the solutions for each part of the vulnerability was a bit of a struggle, but some research helped to answer how to go about doing that. Alternatively, figuring out the false positives was a helpful task to accomplish.

*How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

    I increased layers of security by encrypting the data being sent over the web application and including RESTful API calls to help further secure the code being developed. I also created a self-signed certificate to check to make sure that the data was not modified or altered in transit. In the future I plan to place the security of the software and its code at the beginning of the Software Development Lifecycle to ensure that the code is secure from the beginning and continue to ensure its security as the software progresses and is developed further.

*How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

    After refactoring the code, I would rerun the vulnerability testing to check for new vulnerabilities.

*What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    
    I used the the textbook provided with the course to check on how secure coding should be accomplished for each relevant assignment and project. I also used various articles and other books that may have had other information that was helpful in learning how to create secure code.

*Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

    I would show future employers how I implemented secure coding practices to ensure that the data was encrypted and secure. I would also show future employers that I have successfully learned the skill of vulnerability testing to ensure that there are no vulnerabilities in the code base being developed.
